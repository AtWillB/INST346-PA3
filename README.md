Research Question: Which data science tool is more popular in the data science/statistics community pandas or R?

Technical Skills: Learn how to use the Stack Exchange API.

Description: There are a number of popular data science/statistic tools, including R and Python’s pandas. In this assignment you will investigate the relative popularity of each of these tools by examining the number of related questions posted on Stack Exchange Q&As. In particular you’ll use the Stack Exchange API (Links to an external site.) to get the number of questions which have the tag “pandas” and the number of question which have the tag “R” for three Q&A subcommunities: Stack Overflow (stackoverflow), Cross Validated (stats.stackexchange), and Data Science (datascience.stackexchange) (HINT: you’ll want to look at the API documentation related to tags). In addition, to examining the total number of questions across all three sites with the pandas and R tags, also examine how the three sites differ in the relative number of R and pandas tags. Stack Overflow is a general subcommunity, while Cross Validated is more focused on statistics and Data Science is more focused on data science.

Although the Stack Exchange API uses OAUTH authentication you can also use the API without authenticating. (HINT: you don’t need to go through the process of creating a developer application account or getting an access_token).
